## Hero Section Redesigned ✨

I've completely reimagined the hero section with a **Bloomberg/FT-inspired editorial intelligence briefing aesthetic**. Here's what changed:

### The New Approach

**Typography-Forward Design**
- Massive, confident title (56-120px responsive)
- "INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING" kicker in monospace caps
- Black on white for maximum authority
- Extreme letter spacing (-4px) for impact

**Subtle Architectural Grid**
- Faint 120px×120px grid lines in the background
- Suggests structure, rigor, and systematic analysis
- Creates visual interest without distraction

**Purple as Accent Only**
- 4px stripe along the bottom edge
- Purple gradient reserved for CTA button
- Monochromatic otherwise (black/gray/white)

**Gentle Animation**
- Floating crab (8px gentle rise/fall, subtle rotation)
- No flashy gradients or glowing orbs
- Minimal hover effects (1px lift instead of 2px)

### Why This Works

1. **Authority through restraint** - Bloomberg doesn't need flashy gradients because their content speaks for itself
2. **Distinctive but sophisticated** - The grid pattern and typography scale create visual interest without being "tech startup-y"
3. **Editorial credibility** - Signals "serious intelligence source" not "SaaS landing page"
4. **Mobile-friendly** - Fluid typography, adaptive grid density
5. **Purple still present** - Just used strategically as an accent, not the main event

### What Stayed
- 🦀 floating crab emoji (brand identity)
- Botsup branding clear and prominent
- Same messaging and CTA
- Purple in strategic places (stripe, button)
- Fully responsive

The result feels like a **premium intelligence briefing service** - authoritative, thoughtful, and distinctive without relying on obvious color gradients.
