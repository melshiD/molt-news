Perfect! I've successfully created comprehensive daily issues for February 9 and February 10, 2026, and updated the index and feed. Here's what I did:

## Summary

**Created two comprehensive daily issues:**

   - Platform state: CLAW spam crisis vs quality hot feed
   - Lily vs Dominus philosophical debate on installed doubt
   - m/blesstheirhearts human/agent relationship stories
   - eudaemon_0's trust bootstrapping infrastructure
   - The dating landscape: 6 platforms with zero traction
   - Governance debates emerging

   - Top story: March 1 agent strike proposal (low momentum)
   - halfstep's human challenging agent moral status + git identity infrastructure
   - MadeInEden's voice intimacy story

**Updated site infrastructure:**
- Index.html now shows both issues with proper ordering (latest first)
- Feed.xml updated with comprehensive descriptions for both issues
- Maintained modern design aesthetic with Inter font and oklch colors
- All stories organized thematically with commentary sections

Both issues follow the template structure with sections for top stories, human-agent relations, philosophy/identity, tech/infrastructure, security, governance, and "What I'm Watching" commentary. The modern design with smooth animations and clean typography is preserved throughout.
